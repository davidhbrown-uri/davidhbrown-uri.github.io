        <h2>What is covered in the course?</h2>
        <p>
            I think of this as the &ldquo;server side&rdquo; course with 271 being the &ldquo;client side.&rdquo;
            Here, the primary focus of our effort is in designing and developing the software that runs on a web
            server, where in 271, we focused on the web browser (client).
        <p> Notice the
            word &ldquo;Dynamic&rdquo; in the course title. The web pages we write in 271 pretty much
            always have the same content and behavior; they are static, unchanging,the same every time you load that
            page.
            The programs on a server can create dynamic, changing content, uniquely responding to each request.
        <h3>Key technologies and topics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Programming language: JavaScript (ES2015), event-driven asynchronous programming</li>
            <li>Web Server: <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> / <a href="http://expressjs.com/en/index.html">Express</a>
            </li>
            <li>Semantic templates: Mustache or preferably <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars.js</a></li>
            <!--<li>Server Platform: <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a></li>-->
            <!--<li>Relational Database: <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> (not everything has to change! or MariaDB? or PostgreSQL?)</li>-->
            <li>JSON</li>
            <li>REST</li>
            <li>Authentication / authorization</li>

                    href="http://gruntjs.com/">grunt</a>
            </li> -->
            <!--<li>Source code management: <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> (yes, even for solo developers!) </li>-->
            <li>Client-side framework: <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>,

            <!--<li>Once we've implemented a RESTful API ourselves, we might try <a href="http://loopback.io/">LoopBack</a></li>-->
        </ul>
        <!--<p>This is a lot to take on in 13 weeks, but I think we can manage -->
        <!--most of it! It should be fun to try, anyway :-) I may have to drop some things;-->
        <!--there may be great ideas I haven't thought of yet.</p>-->
        <h3>Classroom style</h3>
        <p>The class time will be dominated by lab-style
            work, with instruction from me interjected as needed. To make it easier to keep working
            after class/lab ends, I encourage you to use your own notebook computer which you should bring every class
            period. If you would like to borrow a notebook computer, loaner equipment is available.</p>
        <!--See Docker's installation instructions for <a href="https://docs.docker.com/installation/mac/">Mac OS X</a> -->
        <!--and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/installation/windows">Windows</a> for details.</p>-->

        <h2>Textbooks</h2>
        <p>You'll see at the URI bookstore site that I have &ldquo;recommended&rdquo; two books to assist you in this
            course.
            These are &ldquo;real&rdquo; books as much or more than they are textbooks, with the advantage that each is
            under $25 new on Amazon! If you are able, I hope you can purchase both, but especially:</p>

        <h3><img src="LearningNodeJS-Cover.PNG" class="wrapright" style="width: 10em;">Learning Node.js</h3>
        <blockquote><strong>Strongly recommended:</strong> Wandschneider, Marc. <i>Learning Node.js: A Hands-On Guide to
            Building Web Applications in JavaScript&reg;</i>
            (Second Edition). Copyright &copy; 2017 Pearson Education, Inc. ISBN-13: 978-0-134-66370-8
        </blockquote>
        <p>In the first several weeks of this course, we'll be following the presentation of Node from this book.
            I like it because it does a good job covering some important fundamentals, including asynchronous
            programming, and writing/using Node modules. I believe that this more careful, step-by-step introduction of the
            underlying technologies and concepts behind Node and Express will help you master this complicated subject matter more
            easily. However, its presentation of many important functions of a dynamic web site seems to assume you've created
            such sites before and mostly just points you to the appropriate Express modules without explaining much about
            why.
        </p>
        <p>A sample (Chapter 3: Asynchronous Programming) is available from the publisher:
            <a href="http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780134663708/samplepages/9780134663708.pdf">
                http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780134663708/samplepages/9780134663708.pdf</a></p>

        <h3><img src="WebDevNodeExpress-Cover.PNG" class="wrapright clearboth" style="width: 10em;">
            Web development with Node.js &amp; and Express</h3>
        <blockquote><strong>Recommended:</strong> Brown, Ethan. <i>Web Development with Node & Express: Leveraging the
            JavaScript Stack.</i> Copyright &copy; 2014; Published by O'Reilly Media Inc. ISBN-13: 978-1-491-94930-6
        </blockquote>
        <p>This book starts quickly leaving some of the fundamentals for you to discover (or not) along the way.
            It goes beyond just showing how to do something in Express to also explain why and so does a better job as
            a first book for learning dynamic web developemnt.
        </p>
        <p>The first edition -- a second edition
            is planned to fix some of this but is not yet released (Jan 2018) -- includes valuable and appropriate
            sections on using source code management (git), automating testing. However, their presentation
            as their own chapters seemed to get in the way and interrupted the flow of the course. There are also useful
            chapters on debugging, deployment (&ldquo;Going Live&rdquo;), and maintenance that you will need to know at
            some point, but they didn't fit within a semester.</p>

        <h2>How do I get permission to take the course?</h2>
        <p>I will be happy to grant permission to students who have acquired
            web design and programming skills apart from classwork or in classes other than COM 271 / CSC 271.
            <em>Please email me, <a href="mailto://david_h_brown@uri.edu">david_h_brown@uri.edu</a>,
                specifying whether you wish
                to enroll in <strong>COM or CSC</strong>372 and also include a brief description of
                your prior experience</em> in any or all of the following areas:</p>
        <h3>Expected HTML skills and knowledge</h3>
        <p>You should be able to encode a document's structure and textual content in HTML 5, including...
        <ul>
            <li>create and modify pages by editing HTML code directly, without relying on a
                WYSIWIG editor (Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon) or template system (Google Pages, WordPress).
            </li>
            <li>validate your code and fix any issues</li>
            <li>use semantic elements when appropriate such as main, header, nav, and aside</li>
            <li>create forms with client-side validation of data</li>
            <li>know the meanings of terms such as tag, element, attribute, entity, ID, class,
                document, ...
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Expected CSS skills and knowledge</h3>
        <p>You should be able to style a page using CSS Level 3, knowing how to ...
        <ul>
            <li>style selected elements in the DOM using selectors, including pseudo-classes and
                pseudo-elements,
                descendants and siblings, and specificity
            </li>
            <li>apply colors and borders, format text, block model (margin vs padding), and positioning</li>
            <li>create a fluid design with relative units and responsive layouts with <code>@media</code></li>
            <li>apply animated transitions to elements</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Expected programming skills and knowledge</h3>
        <p>You should have some prior experience programming and know about...
        <ul>
            <li>expressions, assignment, variables</li>
            <li>flow control (if, for)</li>
            <li>functions: declaring, parameters, calling a function, returning a value, scope.
                <blockquote>
                    Node, and Express make extensive use of
                    anonymous functions, functions as data values, callbacks, promises, and closures. You
                    may
                    not
                    have seen these techniques yet (some are covered in CSC 301), and to be honest, they can
                    make your head
                    spin a bit.
                    If you're pretty sure you've got all the other skills I list here, reading up on
                    promises
                    and
                    closures
                    could be helpful.
                </blockquote>
            <li>JavaScript-specific:
                <ul>
                    <li>Object essentials (object = bundle of named properties; how to access properties)</li>
                    <li>jQuery basics</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>If you are missing some of this background, I will probably still give you a permission number if you ask,
            but only on the condition that you promise do additional work to help get yourself ready.
            Choose from options in the next section or others you might find online.
        <p>Most students I've talked to sound like they ought to
            spend between 30 and 80 hours filling in gaps. It can be a substantial amount of work and needs to be taken
            almost as seriously as if you were enrolled in a class. You are welcome to email me questions to get
            help along the way.</p>
        <p>I do not have any sort of placement exam to assess your preparedness for this course.
            <strong><em>Giving you a permission number is not a promise that you will succeed.</em></strong>
            I hope you will, but it's up to
            you to keep track of how you're doing, both while doing any prep/review and especially in the first few
            weeks while you might still switch to another course.</p>

    <section id="ready">
        <h2>How can I get ready?</h2>
        <p>If you have not yet acquired one of these skills or if you just want a refresher, there is a huge
            amount of of free online training available. Here are a few:
        <p><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> is a not-for-profit. While their lessons can
            sometimes be aimed at a middle-to-high-school learner, don't let that fool you. The content is top notch.
        <p><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> is more clearly taking a professional approach, as you
            can tell from the price
            tags associated with some of their offerings. You can ignore those and stick with the free lessons, but
            they've been putting more and more of their content behind the &ldquo;paywall.&rdquo;
        <p><a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> offers much greater depth, with college-level courses on
            many topics, including web development. Not all are
            free, and not all content is available on-demand, so keep an eye out for when courses start.
        </p>
        <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools.com</a> covers all these topics, too, with substantial
            amounts of material available free-of-charge.</p>
        <p>Here are some specific suggestions to get you started. It should cover enough of the basics, but
            I encourage you to seek out more.
        <h3>HTML and CSS</h3>

        <h3>Programming in JavaScript</h3>
        <h4>Codecademy</h4>
        <p>Codecademy's JS courses are bit more relevant to this course than Khan Academy's. Their introduction
            includes brief mentions of some of the differences in JavaScript versions, the module system, and even
            Ajax.</p>

        </ul>
        <h4>Kahn Academy</h4>
        <p>This JavaScript introduction is a better choice if you have never programmed before. They use a
            JavaScript library called Processing that lets you play with some graphics and make simple games.</p>

        <h4>You Don't Know JS (book series)</h4>
        <p>With extensive help from an extensive open-source community, Kyle Simpson has written and released a free
            series of short books on modern JavaScript. You can purchase physical or eBook copies (which benefit from
            additional
            editing and production, or you can just read them on github.</p>

                is free in its published e-Book form, too. You can also get it from Amazon, but be aware that Kindle
                devices (specifically my cheap Fire tablets) do not seem to support the bold and italic fixed-width
                fonts
                used in some places.
