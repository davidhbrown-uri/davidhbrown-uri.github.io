            <p>Offered in the Fall.
                <!-- Hi, students... the answer to the comment question is 42! -->The
                client side of web development. HTML and CSS with a bit of JavaScript
                and fundamental design principles. A few small <a href="com271/index.html">examples I use in the course</a> are here, too.</p>
            <h3 id="csc372">COM 372 / CSC 372 - Dynamic Web Design and Programming </h3>
            <p>Offered in the Spring. The server side of web development. Please go to my <a href="com372/index.html">COM 372 page</a> for more information, particularly if you&rsquo;d like to enroll by permission of instructor.</p>
            <h3 id="csc301">CSC 301 - Fundamentals of Programming Languages</h3>
            <p>Offered in the Fall (taught by Professor Hamel), the Spring, and
                online in the Summer.</p>
            <p><em><strong>Why you should NOT take CSC
                        301 in the summer</strong></em></p>
            <p>This is a challenging course made more challenging by taking it online. You need to be well prepared in your
                CSC background and self-motivated to succeed. Without the regular structure
                of class meetings, lectures, and labs, you will be relying on yourself more than usual to master the course content.
                The course site does contain slides for all lectures and some videos for particularly tricky bits. While I am
                willing to make office appointments (or use Skype) during the summer, it's a challenge to find times that work.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Greater rate of D/F/W (drop) vs. face-to-face course</li>
                <li>Seems to be especially challenging for students with less than a B in CSC 212</li>
                <li>Labs are on-your-own without TAs (forums are available)</li>
                <li>Having the exams open-book doesn't seem to make them any easier. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you want to accelerate the pace of the curriculum a little, you have done great in your earlier CSC courses, and you like reading technical content, then taking CSC 305 online in the summer is probably a good fit.
                <h3 id="csc305">CSC 305 - Software Engineering </h3>
                <p>Offered in the Fall, Spring, and Summer. Summer sometimes is canceled because of low enrollment... it is a face-to-face class scheduled for all 10 Wednesdays of the Summer 3 session, roughly 8am to 3pm.</p>

        browser. It's available for most browsers, including Firefox, Chrome,

                &rarr; URI asked me to come back and teach a few courses which became a few more...</p>

            <p>I've been doing a fair amount of programming for small, embedded microcontrollers such as Arduino and NodeMCU. Hope to teach myself something about FPGA one of these days, but I'm not sure I have any projects for which that would be relevant. Even further in the hardware direction, I've gotten fairly decent at designing parts for 3D printing and managed to design a functioning printed circuit board.</p>
            <p>I enjoy riding my bicycle to campus (in any weather except if the
                roads are icy, in which case classes are probably canceled anyway).
            </p>
            <p>When I have a little bit of spare time, I enjoy playing pinball
                simulations and if I have a bit more spare time, I'll slowly work
                through first-person adventure games (e.g., Tomb Raider, Witcher,
                Skyrim sort of thing)... usually on easy settings. </p>
